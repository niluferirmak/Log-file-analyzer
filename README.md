# 🛡️ Simple Web Access Log Analyzer

This Python project is designed to analyze web server access logs (Common Log Format) and identify potential security anomalies, such as Brute-Force attempts, Web Scanning activity, and Server Issues. By leveraging built-in Python modules (re for parsing, collections for counting), the tool quickly extracts statistical data from log files and generates an actionable security report.

## ✨ Features

  - Log Parsing: Uses Regular Expressions (re) to process the Common Log Format typically generated by Apache/Nginx web servers.

  - Statistical Summary: Provides core metrics, including total requests, total bytes transferred, and HTTP status code distribution.

  - Anomaly Detection:

      Brute-Force Detection: Flags repetitive instances of 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden errors from the same IP address.

      Web Scanning: Identifies aggressive probing for sensitive files based on a high volume of 404 Not Found errors (e.g., searching for /wp-config.php, .env files).

      Volume Anomaly: Lists IP addresses that exceed a defined request threshold, indicating potential DDoS or heavy automated scraping.

   - Clean Reporting: Presents analysis results in a structured, easy-to-read format in the terminal.

## ⚙️ Setup and Usage
Prerequisites

  - Python 3.x (Uses standard library modules; no external packages required.)

Running the Tool

  - Clone the Repository:
    
        git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LogAnalyzer.git
        cd LogAnalyzer

  - Prepare the Log File:

     Place your log data file, named access.log, in the project directory. (Note: The repository includes an example access.log file with simulated attack scenarios for testing.)

  - Execute the Analyzer:

        python log_file_analyzer.py


## 🛠️ Code Structure

The project is structured around the following key Python functions:

  - analyze_log_file(file_path): Reads the log file, handles decoding issues (encoding='latin-1'), parses each line using Regex, and computes core statistics (status_counter, ip_counter).

  - detect_anomalies(log_data): Scans the collected statistics (e.g., 5xx status codes) against predefined thresholds to identify large-scale operational failures.

  - error_based_analysis(status_counter): Filters and highlights 4xx and 5xx status codes to pinpoint security-relevant risks (Brute-Force vs. Scanning).

  - generate_report(...): Compiles all the findings into the final, readable report structure.
